greenLightDuration is controlled by rotary encoder and displayed on the UI >=1
yellow-light time is five seconds
in alternating mode, if green light or yellow light is on one axis, red is on other.

green light time is whatever red-light time - yellow-light time leaves left with a minimum of 
mode shifted by pushbutton on rotary encoder (to be implemented later)

Alternating mode:
	loop:
		set greenRemaining = greenLight Duration
		when greenlight Duration exhausted set yellow light for yellow-light-duration
		when yellow-light-duration is exhausted, set red light, wait moment, then alternate moving axis 


targets to switch:
	NS_red
	NS_yellow
	NS-green
	EW_red
	EW_yellow
	EW_green


================Deferred to a later version below this line

We will prepare the hardware for using the rotary encode pushbutton, but the multiple modes
will not be in the initial implementation

		four modes:
			alternating
			NS stopped
			EW stopped
			4-way stop
